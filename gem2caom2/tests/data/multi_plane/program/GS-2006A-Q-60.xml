<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
In March-July 2004 we acquired high-quality 12.3um T-ReCS/Gemini images of the intricately shaped dust envelopes around the dust-forming Wolf-Rayet binaries WR112 and WR48a, proving that these particular objects may serve as a test-bed for studies of dust production in the early Universe. Here we propose to complement these spectacular images by spatially-resolved spectra of the freshly formed dust obtained with the MIR TReCS/Gemini spectrograph. This will help to solve the long-standing problem of the chemical pathways of dust formation in the extremely hostile environments of Wolf-Rayet winds, which resemble the shocked, chemically enriched ejecta of type-II Supernovae, presumably the dominant dust-producing sources in the high-redshift Universe.
