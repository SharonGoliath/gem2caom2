<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
QSO absorbers are precise probes of variations in the fine-structure
constant, alpha. While Keck/HIRES spectra suggest a varying alpha,
other groups claim smaller VLT/UVES samples support no
variation. Varying-alpha estimates from single, high S/N absorbers
allow critical assessment of analysis methods and possible systematic
errors. The z_abs=1.1508 absorber towards HE0515-4414 (the brightest
southern QSO at z&gt;1) is almost ideal for this. However, its unusual
complexity has severely affected 3 groups' attempts to fit multiple
velocity-component model absorption profiles, invalidating their
varying-alpha constraints. We propose to triple the UVES spectral
resolution with bHROS which, combined with S/N=50 per spectral pixel,
will allow unambiguous determination of the absorption velocity
structure. bHROS's wavelength stability will then provide the
tightest, most robust single-absorber bound on varying-alpha. bHROS
will also strongly limit any departure of the Mg &amp; C isotopic
abundances from terrestrial values in this absorber.
