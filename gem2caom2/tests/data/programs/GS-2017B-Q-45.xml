<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
To date, the study of accretion rates of quasars at high redshift has been restricted to the most luminous quasars, a biased subset that is likely to show high accretion rates. Despite of this limitation, z&gt;~5 quasars have been depicted as rapidly growing, extraordinary supermassive black holes. Recently, we discovered faint quasars at z~5, providing a much-needed sample to understand the general characteristics of high redshift quasars. The proposed near-infrared FLAMINGOS-2 spectroscopy of nine faint quasars will allow us to measure their black hole masses with Mg II emission line and their accretion rates, which have never been attempted for faint quasars at z~5 or beyond. For the first time, this observation will teach us what the real accretion activity is like for a general, unbiased population of quasars at z~5, broadening our understanding of the growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift.
