<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
A comprehensive investigation of the formation and evolution of giant planets requires a thorough direct imaging search for planets around primaries of all masses. Currently, as past direct imaging surveys have focused on sun-like or more massive primaries, and since relatively few nearby young low-mass stars were known, low-mass stars are under-represented in the sample targeted by previous searches. Using a new Bayesian analysis that takes into account proper motion, sky position, chromospheric activity (Halpha and X-ray), photometry and radial-velocity, we have identified close to 100 new low mass (&gt;M0) members of nearby young (&lt;50 Myr) associations. Being young and nearby, these newly-identified members are ideal targets for direct imaging searches. We propose to observe this sample of new low-mass stars with NICI to search for self-luminous giant planets down to 2 Mjup at orbital separations of 15-500 AU. Our survey will nearly quadruple the number of young M-dwarfs probed for planets and will allow, for the first time, to place constraints on the existence of planets around low-mass stars at a level comparable to what has been done for more massive stars.
