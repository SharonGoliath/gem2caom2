<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">

Using IFU data, we have studied the history of stellar populations in the central 
region of 8 barred spiral galaxies. It shows young bursts located in nuclear bar/ring/spirals, 
non thermal emission, dust lanes, and multiple underlying old populations. 
The importance of the galaxy bar to bring new gas in the galaxy center is put forward. 
GMOS/IFU data, with high spatial resolution is proposed here to push further this
study. We will concentrate on NGC5430, the more massive galaxy in our sample that
offer high spatial resolution. These new data will describe the stellar populations 
and gas in regions located in the galaxy bar and arms. It will provide new constrains 
for the role of bar and interaction in the evolutionary history of galaxies.
