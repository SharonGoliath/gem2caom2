<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We propose one night of near-infrared monitoring of GRS 1915+105 with NIRI on Gemini-North for a targeted study of strong multiwavelength variability. In such a state, where periodic ejections and short-lived jets abound, our proposed observation will reveal the missing link between the disk-jet connection and highly ionized accretion disk winds. This observation, already approved through the Chandra Cycle 12 review process, will be complemented by high time- and spectral-resolution monitoring with Chandra and the EVLA, two of the world's premier X-ray and radio facilities, to make the first-ever direct measurement of jet-disk-wind interactions on timescales possibly as short as 10 seconds. This will be one of the most sensitive and highest-resolution multiwavelength campaigns on this enigmatic black hole to date.
