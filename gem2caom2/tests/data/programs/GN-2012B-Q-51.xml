<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
Correlations linking the mass of the black hole ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) in the centers of galaxies to bulge properties have been clearly established over the past decade. However, there remain major open questions concerning the sparsely populated upper end of the $M_\mathrm{BH}$ distribution. From our spectroscopic survey of 600 galaxies, we have selected two that have the most extreme characteristics. With stellar velocity dispersions of $\sigma_\star &gt; 330$ km s$^{-1}$, Mrk 1216 and NGC 1271 could host some of the most massive black holes known. These galaxies are rapidly rotating, very compact, and have surprisingly small luminosities ($L_\mathrm{bul}$) for their large dispersions, in sharp contrast to the objects typically found at the upper end of the $M_\mathrm{BH}$ $-$ bulge relations. Virial mass estimates place these objects a factor of $\sim$4 and $\sim$50 above the $M_\mathrm{BH} - \sigma_\star$ and $M_\mathrm{BH} - L_\mathrm{bul}$ relations, respectively. With AO-assisted NIFS observations, we will carry out a stellar dynamical mass measurement of the black hole in each of the galaxies to better understand the poorly characterized high end of the relationships.
