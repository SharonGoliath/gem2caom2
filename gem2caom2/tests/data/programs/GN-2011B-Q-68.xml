<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
The Carnegie Supernova 
Project~II (CSP~II) is an NSF-funded, 5-year program to obtain optical and near-IR (NIR) 
observations of 100--150 Type~Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) located in the smooth Hubble flow
($0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.08$).
The main emphasis of the CSP~II is to obtain NIR light curves in order to 
achieve a distance precision of 1$-$2\%, as well as to build 
a definitive low-$z$ reference for future rest infrared observations of SNe~Ia 
at high-$z$ with next-generation dark energy experiments such as WFIRST. 
A key ingredient to realizing these
goals is the measurement of NIR $K$ corrections as a function of light curve
phase and shape, which to date are only poorly 
understood. 
We therefore request 100 hours of ToO time 
over 5 years with GNIRS on Gemini North to obtain multi-epoch NIR spectroscopy
for $\sim$25 of the SNe to be observed by the CSP~II.  In this first proposal, we ask for 
a total of 10~hours to obtain spectra at two different phases of 2--3 SNe.
