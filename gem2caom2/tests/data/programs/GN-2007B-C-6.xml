<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We propose a comparative astrochemical study of the lines of sight toward
two massive young stars embedded in the NGC 7538 molecular cloud.
We already have a substantial set of spectra of IRS 1, with which we have
measured abundances of 7 molecules, several of which have remarkably high
abundances.
Since no other source has been observed in this way, we don't know whether
these abundances are typical of the gas around a newly formed massive star,
or if they result from the unique radiation environment of IRS 1.
We will answer this question by obtaining comparable spectra of IRS 9, a
source in the same cloud, but without the ultraviolet radiation field of
IRS 1.
