<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We have recently discovered a population of luminous star clusters in the far halo of M31.  These objects have luminosities typical of globular clusters, but are much more extended (roughly 5-10x greater half-light radius than typical GCs) and have no known counterparts in the Milky-Way.  Their stellar populations appear old and metal-poor.  The question naturally arises: do these clusters have a dark-matter component (cf. dSphs) or not (cf. GCs)?  This is crucial for understanding their origin, and more broadly, if they do reside in dark-matter halos then they would help explain the apparent deficit of small halos compared to theoretical predictions.  Here we propose multi-slit GMOS spectroscopy of a sample of stars in one of these clusters, to determine its velocity dispersion and hence M/L.  As by-products we will also estimate the spectroscopic metallicity, look for any evidence of kinematic disturbance, and determine the systemic velocity of the cluster.
