<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
In previous surveys of the young Sco-Cen region, we and others have discovered a number of substellar companions with separations of up to several hundreds of AU, some of which have mass ratios to the primary star of only 1%. Such properties challenge both star and planet formation mechanisms. Motivated by this issue, we started a NICI survey of a larger sample of stars in Sco-Cen in 2011A (GS-2011Q-44). In total, 138 stars have been observed in the survey, with 55 detected candidates having been followed up in 2012A to test for common proper motion. We have already confirmed and published 3 new substellar companions from this survey. We now propose to perform the final follow-up efforts by observing 11 remaining targets. With a minor requirement of 2.2 hours, these observations will finalize the survey, potentially yield the widest, youngest, and lowest-mass planetary systems ever imaged directly, and provide key insights to the formation and early evolution of planets.
