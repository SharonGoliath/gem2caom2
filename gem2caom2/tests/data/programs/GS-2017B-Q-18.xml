<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We propose NIR spectroscopic observations of candidates of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) discovered in the ADF-S (AKARI Deep Field - South) to reveal the evolution of massive galaxies at z~2. All DOG samples in this proposal have far-IR/submm counterparts and they are optically identified with KMTNet (Korea Microlensing Telescope Network). We aim to detect the redshifted H-alpha of our samples together with possible other lines, which enables us to know the exact redshifts of DOGs as well as the properties of dust around DOGs. The long-slit spectroscopy with Gemini FLAMINGOS-2 can identify the H-alpha emissions from the DOGs at z~2. We propose to obtain deep long-slit spectroscpy of 9 targets that currently have no H-alpha detection from ground and space. These data set will provides us unique information such as their exact redshifts, their line widths and the dust obscurations at z~2.
