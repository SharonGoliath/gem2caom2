<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
 Is the excess blue emission often seen in cooling flow
    (CF) clusters due to the CF phenomenon, or is there another
    environmental or nuclear process at work in these galaxies? We
    propose to localize and characterize the young stellar populations
    in central galaxies of CF clusters. In 2005, we obtained excellent data for 5
    clusters which confirmed that the technical aspects of the project are feasible. We propose here to add to the work of the previous
    semesters by collecting a sample of clusters, including critically important controls, which will be large enough for us to obtain
    information on the evolution of the central galaxy in relation to
    the CF, the central AGN,  and the role of galaxy-galaxy interactions within the
    cluster.
