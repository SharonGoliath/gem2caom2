<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
The fraction of supernovae missed in optical surveys due to extinction and intrinsic faintness is as much as 50%. We have pioneered the use of Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics on Gemini to reveal a previously hidden population of core-collapse supernovae in Luminous Infra-Red Galaxies (LIRGs). To measure the fraction of heavily obscured supernovae, high-precision infrared observations are essential. The SUNBIRD (Supernovae UNmasked By Infra-Red Detection) project aims to monitor 18 LIRGs with Gemini South through 2016, and in combination with Keck to increase the sample of obscured supernovae by at least a factor of 5. In just our first observing block in March 2015 we discovered 2 supernovae. The data on the LIRGs themselves will be of immense value to the community for understanding the dusty, starbursting galaxies at high redshift.
