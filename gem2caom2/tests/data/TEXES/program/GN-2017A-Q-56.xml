<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We propose to measure the 8–13 micron spectra of Hot Cores around massive protostars at high spectral (R=50,000) resolution and high sensitivity (S/N~100) with the goal of determining the organic inventory of these regions. These data will be combined with existing ground based studies of the M band containing the fundamental bands of CO and its isotopologues and with available and proposed 5.4–8 micron spectra (EXES/SOFIA) to cover the complete 4.5 to 13 micron region. Hot Cores are chemically very diverse as many chemical and physical processes contribute to their molecular content. This spectral region contains the ro-vibrational transitions of many molecules known or expected to be abundant. The absorption line depths and profiles are unique signatures of the absorbing species and the data will be analyzed to determine column densities and abundances relative to CO, as well as the kinematics and the physical conditions in the absorbing gas. Derived abundances can also be directly compared to abundances of interstellar ice components obtained along the same sight-lines. These observations will provide an unprecedented data set, offering a unique view of the molecular content and physical conditions in regions of massive star formation and the physical and chemical processes that play a role in the origin and evolution of Hot Cores. In addition, this survey will provide a benchmark for the interpretation of much lower spectral resolution studies of Hot Corinos and protoplanetary disks around low mass stars to be obtained with MIRI/JWST. To date, no comprehensive, high spectral resolution survey of the entire 4–13 μm spectral region in a large number of sources has been undertaken but with TEXES on Gemini-N and EXES on SOFIA such a comprehensive survey has come into reach, is very timely, and much needed. Besides CO in the M band, various other molecules (C2H2, HCN, NH3, HNCO) have been observed already with TEXES to demonstrate the feasibility of this survey.
