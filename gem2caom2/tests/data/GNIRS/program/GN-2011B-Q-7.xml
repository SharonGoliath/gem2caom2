<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
Despite the spectacular success of wide-field sky surveys (2MASS, SDSS,
and UKIDSS) in uncovering a large population of brown dwarfs in the
solar neighborhood, a gap of nearly 400 K remains between the coolest
spectroscopically confirmed brown dwarfs (\teff $\sim$500 K) and Jupiter 
(\teff$\sim$128 K). Yet it is exactly these cold, low-mass brown dwarfs that are
essential to measuring the functional form of the low-mass mass function
and the lower mass limit of star formation, two critical constraints on
theories of star formation. With atmospheric conditions similar to those
of giant planets, cold brown dwarfs are also excellent proxies with
which to test the ultracool model atmospheres that are critical to our
understanding of exoplanets. One of the primary science goals of the
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), a NASA mission that recently
completed a survey of the entire sky at four mid-infrared wavelengths,
is to discover a large population of these cool brown dwarfs. As part of
a larger follow-up campaign that involves both ground- and space-based
observatories, we propose to obtain Gemini/NIRI $J$ and $H$ band imaging
of 17 candidates with only upper limits ($J&gt; $19) and Gemini/GNIRS 1$-$2.5 
$\mu$m spectra of 9  cool brown dwarf candidates.
