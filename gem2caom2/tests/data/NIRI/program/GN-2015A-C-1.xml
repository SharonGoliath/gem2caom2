<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We discovered that the Galilean satellites in eclipse are bright (∼ 10−6 of their uneclipsed brightness). According to our model, hazes in the Jovian upper atmosphere scatter sunlight to illuminate the satellites in eclipse. Thus we propose to observe the Galilean satellite eclipses to investigate the property of hazes and their vertical distribution in the Jovian atmosphere at several to several tens mbar region, where has been poorly observed by previous observations. This method is very unique because we can resolve the vertical structure of hazes well above the previous limits. Observations of deep eclipses are essential to construct the Jovian atmospheric model, and S15A is the only season in the next six years to observe such deep eclipses, thus observations in this S15A season is highly required. Another important point of this method is that we can obtain the transmission spectrum of Jupiter projected on the Galilean satellites in eclipse. In our observations, we will also take a spectroscopic light curve of ingress and egress of eclipses. The transmission spectrum and its light curve of the Jovian atmosphere taken by our method will be a comparison standard to characterize the atmosphere of the exo-planets investigated by transit observations.
