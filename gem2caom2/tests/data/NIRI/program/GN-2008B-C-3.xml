<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We propose 4 nights with Gemini--North and NIRI to study the effects of
feedback in the ISM of massive, star-forming (SF) galaxies at
$2.2&lt;z&lt;2.6$ (sBzK), with and without luminous Compton--thick (CT) AGN
hosted in them. We will measure the velocity and geometry of the
large--scale motions of the interstellar gas from the redshift
difference between the \halpha\ line, which traces the systemic
redshift, and the UV low-ionization interstellar absorption lines and
\lya, whose spectra we already have. This is the same methodology used
to study galactic winds in Lyman--break galaxies at $z\sim 2$--3
(BX/LBG). The key new element here is that the SF rate and stellar mass
of the selected sBzK are $~\sim 10\times$ higher than those of their
BX/LBG counterparts at the same redshift, and half of them host a
luminous, Compton--tick AGN. We will study if the feedback depends on
the presence of a powerful CT AGN, whose energy is absorbed and
re--irradiated by the ISM, but the fraction retained as mechanical energy
is unknown. By comparing with the LBG, we will also study how the
feedback depends on SF rate and mass. These observations will be one of
the first attempts to provide empirical information on feedback and its
relationship with physical properties of galaxies at the cosmic time
when some massive galaxies were already passively evolving.
