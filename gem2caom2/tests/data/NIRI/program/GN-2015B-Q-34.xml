<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
Star formation rates in cluster spirals are debated, as H-alpha and FIR provide very different estimates. Two ways to reconcile them are: H-alpha underestimates SFR due to dust extinction, or FIR overestimates SFR as dust is heated by older stars. We propose a new diagnostic to resolve the debate, the Pa-alpha line. We will thus clarify whether the SF decline in cluster spirals occurs quickly or slowly and test scenarios for transforming spirals into S0s.
