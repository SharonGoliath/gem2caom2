<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We propose to use FLAMINGOS-2, GNIRS and NIRI to follow-up candidate Y dwarfs from a new search  of the WISE catalog.  Our method uses WISE multiple measurements and photometric profile fit information to identify non-variable point sources which are detected only in the W2-band, the band most sensitive to very cool brown dwarfs.  This search identifies 121 previously unknown candidates down to a S/N=8 limit and probes the lowest Teff that WISE is sensitive to. Initial near-IR followup produced photometry for 13 sources, of which 9 are T8 and earlier T types, three are new 500K T9 dwarfs and one is a new 400K Y0 dwarf. When followup is complete we should approximately double the known number of WISE brown dwarfs cooler than 500K. In 13B we request time to obtain J-band photometry for 85 sources, which make up 75% of our remaining unmatched sample. We expect to find ~8 new Y dwarfs, for which we will also obtain H-band photometry. For the brightest new Y dwarfs we will  obtain spectra. We expect there will be up to three more semesters where we request  time for this project, to image and followup the remaining 25% of our sample, and confirm and characterize new Y dwarfs.
