<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We propose to continue studies of the chemical evolution of the Galactic Center
by carrying out abundance analyses of cool giants in the central cluster of
the Galaxy.  Our earlier pioneering work showed a near solar Fe abundance
in the Galactic Center, but firm results for other elements are needed. 
Using high quality Phoenix spectra, we will examine the abundance trends of
Fe, Ni, Na and the $\alpha$-elements Mg, Si, Ca and Ti in a sample of GC stars,
and directly compare these to populations in the Bulge and Disk.
The abundances of C, N, and O, and the isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and
$^{16}$O/$^{17}$O will allow us to probe the extent of mixing in evolved
GC stars, a significant difference from that seen in disk and bulge stars
could be due to a rather different star formation and angular momentum history.
