<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
High spatial resolution Chandra X-ray image has recently revealed that the
central region of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 3393 contains a close pair
of obscured AGNs. However, the host galaxy does not exhibit the disrupted morphology and vigorous star
formation seen in NGC 6240, another double AGN. NGC 3393 therefore resembles a merging scenario with a
smaller companion - the minor merger evolution that has long been
sought for.  We propose to perform spatially resolved, integral
field K-band spectroscopic observations of NGC 3393 with Gemini+NIFS and the laser guide star system. We will measure the relative velocities and masses of the two nuclei,
and the gas/stellar dynamics in this rare and important merging
system, which will provide clues on the geometry and stage of the
merger process.
