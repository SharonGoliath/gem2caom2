<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We select the highest redshift galaxy clusters by combining X-ray and near-infrared observations from the XMM Cluster Survey and UKIDSS Deep eXtragalactic Survey respectively (DXS). Having access to both of these rich datasets provides us with a unique opportunity to select galaxy clusters in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2. This proposal builds on our recent successful follow-up of UKIDSS near-infrared selected and XCS X-ray selected clusters. The former yielding 11 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.3 clusters including the discovery of a massive supercluster at z=0.9 while the latter discovered the most distant X-ray cluster (XMMXCSJ2215, z=1.46). By combining our near-infrared and X-ray selection we will discover the highest redshift galaxy clusters yet known, significantly increasing the number of clusters above z=1 and pushing out beyond z=1.5. This will provide ourselves and others with the tools to test hierarchical build up of the most massive structures in the Universe and the evolution of their component galaxies.
