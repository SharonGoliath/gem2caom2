<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
More than 60 exoplanets have been discovered to transit their parent star. This configuration provides the only means to accurately measure orbital inclination and planetary radii,  to later infer mass and density, critical parameters to constrain the models necessary to understand
the physics of exoplanetary interiors and their evolution. To this date, searches of exoplanets by transit have only detected gaseous giant planets, i.e., Hot Jupiters. But it has been further realized that the analysis of the light curves of these transiting planets can be use for the detection of planetary companions. In particular the presence of variations in the timing of transits (TTVs) can be attributed to the presence of otherwise undetectable Earth-like planets in the system. We propose to monitor transit events for OGLE planet candidates. Parameters obtained from these transit events, together with those derived by data being obtained during semester 2008b, 2009a, 2009b and those available in the literature, will allow to search for variations in the timing of the central transit, potentially discovering yet unseen low-mass companions.
