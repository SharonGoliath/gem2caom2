<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We have deep Spitzer/MIPS 24\micron \ observations for 17 galaxy clusters
at $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8$.  Our cluster sample is drawn from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey,
and not only spans an important range of velocity
dispersions not represented in other surveys, but also benefits from a
wealth of ancillary data.
Because our MIPS imaging provides dust-obscured star-formation rates
down to 2~$h_{70}^{-2}~\rm M_\odot~yr^{-1}$, we are in a position to significantly
increase the census of star-forming galaxies in dense environments at
$0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8$.  However, to maximize the
scientific return of the Spitzer data, we need to confirm cluster membership
of the 24\micron \ sources.  The available photometric redshifts,
accurate to $\Delta z = \pm 0.1$, are too crude. 
We therefore request Gemini/GMOS-S time
to complete spectroscopy for all $R&lt; 23$ MIPS sources.
Our spectroscopy is designed to detect [O~II] emission from star-forming cluster galaxies,
and we expect to detect $35\pm 11$ cluster galaxies per field,
yielding a total sample size of $600 \pm 200$ galaxies for the 17 clusters. 
Our immediate science goals include 1) a measurement of the cluster
infrared luminosity function, for comparison with measurements made in
both the coeval field and in local clusters, and 2) an investigation
of the role of cluster 24\micron \ sources in the build up of the red
sequence.
