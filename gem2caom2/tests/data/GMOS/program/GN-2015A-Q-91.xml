<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
Star cluster populations reflect the star-formation history (SFH) of the galaxy where they form in. This is a basic principle on which we have used the age distribution of star clusters to deduce the SFH of an interacting spiral galaxy M51 (e.g., Hwang &amp; Lee 2010). However, star clusters have yet to fulfill this long sought after mission, as there are still some, often contradicting, debates as to how star clusters disrupt and what is the fundamental form of cluster mass function as well as how these two issues would affect the age distribution of star clusters. Here we propose to obtain spectra of about 100 star clusters with V&lt;20.8 mag in an interacting spiral galaxy M51 to derive the most reliable and conclusive age distribution of star clusters in a single galaxy. Since the different disruption scenarios affect the bright end of the cluster luminosity function in different ways (e.g. Larsen 2009), we aim to test the currently suggested cluster disruption scenarios and cluster mass functions, based on the spectroscopically derived age distribution of massive (bright) clusters.
