<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
Previous studies of jet-driven outflows from radio-loud AGNs have consistently shown sub-solar gas metallicities. However, our recent study of an outflow driven by a very young radio jet revealed a significantly higher metallicity, suggesting substantial changes in the metal abundance during the course of an outflow's evolution. We seek to constrain the metallicity of three additional young jet-driven outflows to establish a possible evolutionary trend.
