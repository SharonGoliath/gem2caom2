<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
Binary central stars of planetary nebulae are valuable tools with which to study the evolution of close binary systems.  We propose to obtain orbit-resolved spectra of three eclipsing binary central stars of planetary nebulae in order to determine the physical parameters of those systems and add to a small number of already well-analyzed systems.  The study of these binary systems has direct impacts on a number of astrophysical studies including common envelope evolution, the ejection and shaping of planetary nebulae, formation of cataclysmic variables, and the formation of Type IA supernova progenitors.
